## **INTRODUCTION** 

In the realm of modern computing, the emergence of Edge Computing has revolutionized the way we process and analyze data. Traditionally, data processing occurred in centralized cloud servers, necessitating data to travel back and forth between the source (e.g., IoT devices, sensors) and the cloud. While this approach is effective for many applications, it does have limitations, particularly in scenarios requiring real-time responses and where continuous internet connectivity is not guaranteed.

Edge Computing addresses these limitations by moving data processing closer to the source of data generation. This means that computation happens directly on or near the device or sensor, reducing the distance and time it takes for data to travel. This proximity to the source enables near-instantaneous decision-making, making it invaluable for applications where split-second responses are critical.
